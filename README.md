# Cryptocarrency_arbitrage_bot

This is a simple arbitrage bot. It works without any api keys.
You can try to find opportunity to trade arbitrage.
It based on CCXT (https://github.com/ccxt/ccxt)

It will work better if I will realise it with websocket data.
There are one problem with arbitrages in criptocurrencies, sometimes exchanges blocking withdraw or deposit of crypto, but they don't stop trading inside the exchage, so arbitrage which is found with this script can be very much, but it's not possible to realise this profit. Sometimes arbitrage can be able to trade for a long time, but it's not possible to trunsfer cripto between exchanges and spead between best bid and best ask is not closing on different exchanges.

P.S.
And of couse you can find the arbitrage with this script, but it needs very good connection to exchange to trade it.
